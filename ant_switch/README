A Raspberry Pi Pico is used to control these.
- 4-port relay controlled antenna switch
- 2-way transfer switch (2x 2-port coax switch)

The control is done through one button. One short press to cycle through the ports. 
A long press ~ 1.5 seconds switches between the antenna selector (ANT) and the transfer
switch (XFR). 

The WIZnet Ethernet Hat for Pico is used to allow the control over the network. The
core 0 handles the network finctions while core 1 handles the button presses and LCD
updates.  DHCP is used for the network setup. The network link sensing logic allows
automatic recovery of the TCP service from DHCP or link outages. A simple http server
runs on port 3209.

Supported requests
- GET /status  : returns the current antenna and transfer port numbers separated bya comma.
- GET /set?a=n : sets the antenna port to n (1-4).
- GET /set?x=n : sets the transfer port to n (1-2).

The individual coax relays are grounded on one leg and actuated by applying +12V DC. For
this reason, an additional 4-port relay board is used to interface the Pico and the
relays. R1 (relay1) is used to switch between the transfer port 1 and 2. Other 3 relays
are used to actuate one of the 4 antenna switching relays.

A1 - A4 : Relays on the 4-port antenna switch
T1 - T2 : Relays on the transfer switch. Two relays tied together.
NC : Normally closed contact of the relay
NO : Normally open contact of the relay
COM: Common contact
